<p>Vanilla ice cream fans: if you don't fancy paying premium prices this summer you might want to think about switching your order.</p> 

<p>In the past year, the vanilla bean has doubled in price because of high global demand and low supply in vanilla producing regions.</p> 

<p>The U.S., the world's biggest buyer of vanilla, is likely to feel the affects of this as companies using the ingredient could raise their prices to cover mounting costs.</p>

<p>According to Mintec, a commodities intelligence firm, vanilla was sold for $97.5 per kilo in April 2015 by March this year it shot up to $223 a kilo.</p> 

<p>It is the second most expensive spice in the world after saffron because of the long and labor-intensive process it takes to grow it. The beans are hand-pollinated and each flower only opens at one part of one day during the season. If you miss the chance to pollinate then, no pod is produced.</p>

<p>The map represents 12 of the 15 vanilla bean producing countries in 2013 according to latest data from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</p> 

<p>Indonesia and Madagascar are currently the main producers of vanilla but thanks to poor flowering the African island had a bad harvest in 2015. The beans were lower quality and some were harvested too early. Accroding to David Vanderwalde, director of Aust & Hachmann, a vanilla bean buyer based in Canada, a typical crop in Madagascar would be around 2,000 tonnes; in 2015 it was 1,300 tonnes.</p>  


<p>A report done by David Michael & Co, a creator of food flavors in the U.S., showed that there has also been a steady increase in farmers moving into more lucrative crops in Madagascar as prices for the bean dropped between 2010 and 2013 to $25 per kilo. Those farmers that did stay in the game tried their best to get the most out of their investment and held back supplies to drive up prices.</p> 

<p>They also started to harvest the pods earlier than normal and package them up into vacuum-sealed containers rather than drying and curing them. This was partly to avoid theft but the packaging also allowed them to wait until the most profitable moment to sell.</p> 

<iframe style='float: right;'   width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rTCV97b1kE1YI5bkTdRyQdd-2kZAzKC2Q4n1gyqucTQ/pubchart?oid=343205359&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>


<p>Soaring prices are likely to hurt everyone that uses the ingredient from drinks companies to perfume makers. However, ice-cream companies will be impacted the most as this is one of the most expensive ingredients in their production process.</p> 

<p>Mark Becker, co-owner of Max and Minas Ice cream in Brooklyn, said that his costs have gone up by over 300 percent this year.</p>

<p>"We often spend $1600 on vanilla beans, but this month we spent almost $5000. This jump was similar to what we saw last year when there was an increase in the price of eggs after the avian flu scare." he said.</p> 

<p>Becker is refusing to increase the cost for the consumer and has decided to take the hit himself in the hope that prices will drop later on in the year.</p>  

<p>Brian Smith, owner of New York based Ample Hills Creamery was less concerned about rising vanilla costs.</p>  

<p>"95 percent of ice cream comes from a cow," he said. "If the price of cream rose 50 percent we would raise our prices but for now we will eat the cost."</p>

<p>But other ice-cream sellers may be less generous or forced to switch to synthetic alternative because of a lack of supply.</p>

<p>If prices do rise consumers may look to get their frozen ice fix elsewhere, which could mean more business for frozen yogurt makers where the standard flavor 'natural' contains no vanilla flavor. Statista data showed that frozen yogurt sales are expected to increase from 7.3 billion to 9.30 billion by 2017 and with average prices considerably lower, they could take more market share.</p> 

<p>For now ice cream makers are hoping that this summer's harvest, which is ready for shipment in November, will be more bountiful, supply will finally even out, and prices will return to reasonable levels once more. </p> </article>
