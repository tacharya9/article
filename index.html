	<p> Vanilla ice cream fans: if you don't fancy paying premium prices this summer you might want to think about switching your order.</p> 

<p> In the past year, the vanilla bean has doubled in price because of high global demand and low supply in vanilla producing regions.</p>

<p> The U.S., the world's biggest buyer of vanilla, is likely to feel the affects of this as companies using the ingredient could raise their prices to cover mounting costs.</p>

<p> According to Mintec, a commodities intelligence firm, vanilla was sold for $97.5 per kilo in April 2015 by March this year it shot up to $223 a kilo.</p>

<p> t is the second most expensive spice in the world after saffron because of the long and labor-intensive process it takes to grow it. The beans are hand-pollinated and each flower only opens at one part of one day during the season. If you miss the chance to pollinate then, no pod is produced. </p>
